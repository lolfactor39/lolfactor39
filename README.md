## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 13 year old fullstack developer. I can create APIs, and am learning cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I also try ML and DL projects on my extremely powerful AMD Ryzen 4000 series with AMD Integrated Graphics on my wonderful Acer Swift 3 from 2020.
<br>
I am currently just trying out different projects. 
<br>
Ya wanna find me? Reach me out to krupaldeveloper@gmail.com or go to <a href = "//lolfactor39.github.io">my portfolio</a>. You can also contact me by my discord: lolfactor39

Btw, most of my work is private, but I will post some cool stuff later...
