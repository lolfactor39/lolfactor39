## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack developer. I can create APIs, and am learning cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I also try ML and DL projects on my extremely powerful AMD Ryzen 4000 series with AMD Integrated Graphics on my wonderful Acer Swift 3 from 2020.
<br>
I am currently just trying out different projects.
